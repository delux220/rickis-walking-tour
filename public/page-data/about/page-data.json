After covid hit, I decided to change my career & become a NYC tour guide. This way I managed to combine my love for the city adding some jokes while snapping a few photos in between.  I enjoy making new friends and connecting with people. Doing stand-up comedy for over 10 years taught me how to break the ice in 2 seconds, so every tour & photoshoot will feel like a friendly hang out & not a stressful chore. For those of you who feel immediate discomfort in-front of the camera, fear no more, before every session there's a mandatory 2 shots of tequila.\nI'm joking.\nBut have no fear, my photoshoots are fun & easy going, you will feel like Beyonce for a day.  Together we'll have a stress free photoshoot, as we learn the history of the most beautiful neighborhoods in NYC. <3"}},"locale":"en","Photo":{"formats":{"medium":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1683970203/medium_rs_w_1534_m_copy_829d469c65.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1683970204/large_rs_w_1534_m_copy_829d469c65.jpg"}},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1683970203/rs_w_1534_m_copy_829d469c65.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/","langKey":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1656671055","222513066"],"slicesMap":{}}
