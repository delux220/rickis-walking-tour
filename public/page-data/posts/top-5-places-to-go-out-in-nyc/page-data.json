Now the big problem really starts, WHAT TO WEAR?</p><p>Not everyone can rock the same outfits &amp; same colors, so which is right for you ?</p><p>My recommendation to all my clients is wear colors that contrast &amp; bring out your skin color - for example if your have dark skin wear yellow, if you have light skin DON’T WEAR YELLOW.</p><p>Some colors are just beautiful on most skin types &amp; really overall complements the photo. You can plug them on a necklaces or a scarf or even earrings so that your face will pop &amp; not blend with your outfit. Those colors are: Aqua, hot pink, light blue, light green, dark pink, even purple sometimes, &amp; red.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t recommend black or white even tho that’s everyones go to color.. I call it escape to black &amp; white. You wear black &amp; white everyday, we want this shoot to bring out your beautiful self. Black &amp; white tends to blend with the crowd, it won’t pop with city view &amp; in my humble opinion it’s a very safe &amp; dull choice. When I say black &amp; white I don’t mean wedding dress, of course, because it has unique shape &amp; it’s usually big &amp; makes up for it’s color. SO be my guest to wear a giant tutu skirt!&nbsp;</p><p>Now, go home try some outfits on with different colors, send the pictures &amp; ask your best friend which color makes you look the best. That should work. if your’e still unsure send it to me :D</p><p>Now what kinda clothes you should wear? Defiantly something you feel comfortable in. BUT NO SWEATSHIRTS. please. Nothing too tight i’d suggest, that sits well on your body. I have big thighs &amp; long torso - for me everything is high waist till I die. DO NOT CARE what the fashion trend is. High waist everything looks great on me all year long. I mention it so you wear what compliments your body the most, &amp; do not follow trendy outfits that usually only tall skinny girls can pull off. If the outfit doesn't make you feel like Beyonce then it's not the right outfit.</p><p>If you insist on boring quiet colors that’s ok, that’s what you feel comfortable the most, I understand, I don’t judge, even tho it sounds like I am, but what you can do is add an accessory that will make it a little different then day to day outfit. Big fun necklace, scarf, earrings, hat can be tricky, honestly most people don’t look better with a hat unless your’e on the beach.</p><p>My last tip is bring 2 outfits, one you would never dare to wear in real life &amp; the other you most likely will wear on Amanda’s wedding. This way there’s no regrets. (Amanda is not real)</p><p>My point is, your’e coming to NYC, the land of endless possibilities, where nobody cares if you wear a trash bag or a Gucci bag. You will be ignored either way.</p><p>Hope this helped :)</p><p>If you would like to hire my all time go to stylist please send a request via website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See you soon</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>xoxo</p><p>Ricki&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>"}},"locale":"en","Image":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1689341058/8_X9_A7814_116561c63e.jpg","alternativeText":"family portraits nyc","formats":{"medium":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1689341059/medium_8_X9_A7814_116561c63e.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1689341058/large_8_X9_A7814_116561c63e.jpg"}}},"Slug":"dare-to-wear-it-for-a-photoshoot","Description":"What to consider when you pick up clothes for a photoshoot ","Title":"Dare to wear it for a photoshoot ??","publishedAt":"2023-07-14T14:37:17.242Z","updatedAt":"2023-07-14T14:46:57.820Z"}},"author":{"Title":"About RIcki","Description":"Ricki is a comedian, photographer, and tour guide in NYC.
