This year, I started doing walking tours in the city to combine my \"crowd work\" skills :D and photography into one business :) I enjoy making new friends, and connecting with people. Doing stand-up comedy for 10 years taught me how to break the ice in 2 seconds, so even if you get a little discomfort from a big camera lens, but still want great photos, I AM YOUR GAL. Together we'll have a stress free photoshoot, as we learn the history of the most beautiful neighborhoods in NYC. <3"}},"locale":"en","Photo":{"formats":{"medium":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1683970203/medium_rs_w_1534_m_copy_829d469c65.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1683970204/large_rs_w_1534_m_copy_829d469c65.jpg"}},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/meshed-nyc/image/upload/v1683970203/rs_w_1534_m_copy_829d469c65.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/","langKey":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1656671055","222513066"],"slicesMap":{}}
